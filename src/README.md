# Getting Started

The **Powered by the Apocalypse** (PbtA) system for Foundry VTT is a generic system that is built as a framework to allow you to build out character sheets for _most_ systems that would be considered PbtA, assuming they include playbooks, character advancement, and a 2d6 (or similar, such as 2d10 or d6+d8) core mechanic that revolves around ranges of success.

This guide will help you configure the system so that you can run campaigns in your preferred setup. Generally, you should only have to complete the steps in this guide once when creating a new world.

## How to Use This Guide

This guide is broken into the following major sections:

1. **Configuring Your System** - Describes the basic structure of the sheet configuration and how to write the TOML syntax (similar to .ini files) used to configure it.
2. **Configuring Dice Rolls and Results** - How to configure your dice roll formula, modifiers to the rolls based on stat toggles (e.g. "Highlight" or "Debility"), and how to create result ranges such as 6-, 7-9, and 10+.
3. **Configuring Character Sheets** - How to configure the 5 groups used by character sheets: stats, top attributes, left attributes, move types, and equipment types.
4. **Configuring NPC Sheets** - How to configure the 3 groups used by NPC sheets: top attributes, left attributes, and move types.
5. **Making Changes to Existing Worlds** - Gotchas to be aware of when changing the sheet configuration for worlds that already have characters created.
6. **Configuration Reference** - Reference pages that describe all of the sheet configuration options in a reference format rather than guided tutorial.
7. **Error Reference** - Reference page that describes common errors in the sheet configuration dialog and ways to resolve them.
8. **Pbta Sheet Presets** - A collection of character and NPC sheet presets for popular PbtA RPGs. Message me at `asacolips#1867` on Discord to submit new presets!
