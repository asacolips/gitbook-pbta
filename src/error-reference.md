If there are errors with your sheet configuration, it will be prevented from saving with a message to explain why. Eventually this page will include a reference listing of common errors, but if you're unable to resolve an issue based on the error message output by the system, head to the #powered-by-the-apocalypse channel of the Foundry Virtual Tabletop Discord for more advice.
